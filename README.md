## Description

Turtle Crossing Game is a simple Python game built using the Turtle graphics library. The game involves a turtle attempting to cross a busy road while avoiding oncoming cars. As the game progresses, the speed of the cars increases, presenting a greater challenge for the player. This project utilizes multiple classes and applies object-oriented programming (OOP) concepts for improved code organization and readability.

## Features

- **Turtle Movement**: Control the turtle's movement using the arrow keys to navigate across the road.
- **Car Spawning**: Cars randomly spawn on the road and move from right to left at varying speeds.
- **Collision Detection**: Detect collisions between the turtle and the cars. The game ends if the turtle collides with a car.
- **Level Up**: As the turtle successfully crosses the road, the level increases, and the speed of the cars becomes faster.
- **Game Over**: When the turtle collides with a car, the game displays a "Game Over" message.
- **Scoreboard**: Displays the current level of the game, indicating the player's progress.
